### This project explores some Covind-19 datasets to find and select factors/signals to be used as predictors to a specific Covid related metric, such as death rate, hospitalization rate, infection rate, ect. The final goal is to use the selected factors/signals to build a statistical model that will generate desired predictions for a specific metric
